# About this project
Razer released a new fearture on their Huntsman gaming keyboard series called Snap Tap, and I realize that this feature is just a hardware level of "Null Bind" script that exist for a long ago, so that would be not worth to invest on a 250$ keyboard just for a script even if I want to try it so much. 
So I decided to make my own a keyboard and play around with that feature and still capable to add more feature if wanted and most important, still in a budget.
