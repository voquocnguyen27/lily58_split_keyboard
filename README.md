# About this project
This project was created because of my love for split keyboards, my desire to try it out but don't have the conditions to meet the price offered by the manufacturer. Also, I want to try some advance feature on a much more expensive keyboard but still in a budget.
# Skills
This project is based on basic knowledge of electronic circuits, micro controllers, circuit making techniques and programming skills for micro controllers.
# Tools
Schematic and PCB was created in KiCAD with the external library provided by the lily58 creator. You can find the source here:
